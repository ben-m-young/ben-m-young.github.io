## Awards
### Graduate Student Instructor Award, UW-Madison Computer Sciences, 2023-2024

The Computer Sciences department at UW-Madison presents this award annually for
excellence in teaching by a graduate student TA. I won for my work as a TA and Head TA for Introduction
to Algorithms (CS 577). In these roles, I led multiple weekly discussion sections with 40-50
students, wrote and graded exam and quiz questions, led weekly small-group review sessions, 
and held office hours.
