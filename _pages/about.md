I am a PhD student in the [Theory of Computing Group](https://research.cs.wisc.edu/areas/theory/)
at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by Professor 
[Jin-Yi Cai](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jyc/). I am interested in the theory of counting
problems on graphs, including Holant, \#CSP, and counting graph homomorphisms. In particular, 
I study *counting indistinguishability*: if two (sets of) tensors are indistinguishable 
parameters to a counting problem, what is the algebraic relationship between them? 
My work has determined the algebraic relationships corresponding to three families of
counting problems: [isomorphism for \#CSP](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.13688), 
[quantum isomorphism for planar \#CSP](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3689486),
and [orthogonal transformation for (real valued) Holant](https://drops.dagstuhl.de/entities/document/10.4230/LIPIcs.ICALP.2025.136).
I am also interested in quantum computing, especially as it relates to
counting problems and tensor networks.

I completed a B.S. and M.S. in Computer Science and B.A. in Mathematics at Case Western Reserve
University in 2021, advised by Professor [Harold Connamacher](https://case.edu/engineering/about/faculty-and-staff-directory/harold-connamacher). My [M.S. thesis](https://etd.ohiolink.edu/acprod/odb_etd/ws/send_file/send?accession=case1618269661285196&disposition=inline) studied the connections between
totally symmetric and medial quasigroups and Abelian groups.
